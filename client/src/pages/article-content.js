      `During my Senior Year, amidst the pandemic, I chose to pursue Accountancy, Business, and Management (ABM). My interest was fueled by a love for watching videos, listening to podcasts on entrepreneurship, and reading influential books like Rich Dad Poor Dad and Think and Grow Rich.`,
      `As a child, I dreamed of becoming a flight attendant. I vividly remember trips to the airport, where the last to disembark were the flight attendants, walking with confidence, speaking with poise, and donning uniforms that were demure, classy, and elegant.`,
      `Initially, I enrolled in a Bachelor of Science in Architecture. High school sparked my love for sketching houses, and in real life, I was always mesmerized by beautiful homes and buildings during our travels.`,
      `So, how did I end up in tech? Well, it’s true that childhood dreams often evolve. Tech wasn’t even on my radar at first, but I’m slowly falling in love with it. Taking this course has challenged me to build a habit of continuous learning, even during school breaks. Tech is vast and complex; it demands deep thinking and problem-solving, which can be overwhelming at times. But I’ve learned that while the path of learning isn’t linear, persistence is key. Though I may not be naturally gifted in tech, I’m passionate about it, and that passion drives me to create interactive projects and websites, like this blog.`,
      `To stay on track, I plan my day in advance. I print out a calendar and write down three important tasks, ranking them by difficulty. My approach is simple:`,
      `Morning: Tackle the hardest task.`,
      `Afternoon: Work on the intermediate task.`,
      `Night: Handle the light task and then rest.`,
      `Before bed, I review what I’ve accomplished. It’s okay if I don’t complete everything—what matters is striving to do better tomorrow. I’ve come to appreciate a Stoic saying by Marcus Aurelius: “You could be good today. But instead, you choose tomorrow.” This quote serves as a powerful reminder to take action today, rather than putting things off for a future that may never come.`,

      `During my elementary days, I hated reading long stories; I preferred having them read to me while I just listened. My attention span wasn’t very long, and I easily got distracted.`,
      `High School Influence: I gradually recognized the value of improving my attention span and reading comprehension, inspired by my friends' enthusiasm for Wattpad, though my interest in it was short-lived.`,
      `Pandemic Shift: As I prepared for college during the pandemic, I took short courses on Coursera and discovered the importance of reading books.`,
      `Starting with Atomic Habits: At 18, my first book, “Atomic Habits”, taught me the power of small daily habits, showing that a 1% improvement each day can lead to substantial change, with success being the result of consistent effort rather than a single transformation.`,
      `Lessons from Other Books:`,
      `Ikigai: I discovered the 80/20 rule for staying healthy—eating a little less than our hunger demands rather than stuffing ourselves.`,
      `Tuesdays with Morrie: This book taught me that “once you learn how to die, you learn how to live” and that “without love, we are birds with broken wings.”`,
      `Ego is the Enemy: The book is organized into three parts: Aspire, Success, and Failure. It emphasizes being humble in our aspirations, gracious in success, and resilient in failure. It taught me not to let ego drive my aspirations, to achieve success without ego, and to push through failure with strength, not ego.`,
      `Daily Stoic (January 5th): I learned, “Let all your efforts be directed to something; let it keep that end in view. It’s not activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions of things that drive them mad.”`,
      `48 Laws of Power (Law 29: Plan All the Way to the End): This law advises planning to the end to avoid being overwhelmed by circumstances and knowing when to stop. It teaches us to gently guide fortune and help determine the future by thinking far ahead.`,
      `The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People (Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind): Having an end in mind is no guarantee that you’ll reach it—no Stoic would tolerate that assumption—but not having an end in mind is a guarantee that you won’t.`,
      `Surrounded by Idiots: I discovered that I am a “Blue,” driven by the desire to comply and do things as they are meant to be done. Blue traits include being introverted, obedient, organized, meticulous, cautious, and private.`,
      `Favorite Book: The Alchemist: My favorite book so far is The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho. It explores the concept of people’s inability to choose their own Personal Legends and ends by revealing the world’s greatest lie. The book taught me that “when you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.” It emphasizes the importance of recognizing omens and following them, and how learning to understand the language without words can help me understand the world.`,

      `A Lesson from My Sister:
Now, I understand why my elder sister works so hard in her career. Traveling is her reward for all the sleepless nights and multiple projects. It’s a reminder that everything you work hard for eventually pays off, allowing you to enjoy the fruits of your labor and reach the places you’ve always dreamed of visiting.

First Trip to Boracay (February 2023):
My first travel experience was in Boracay, where we stayed at Piccolo Hotel. The hotel’s two pools and super cold air conditioning made our stay comfortable. On our first day, I noticed the diverse nationalities around — Americans, Koreans, Japanese, and Chinese — all enjoying the bars, restaurants, and the beach. This exposure to different cultures made me realize that immersing yourself in new environments introduces you to diverse traditions, languages, and beliefs that challenge your existing views. I loved island hopping, appreciating the beauty of the islands, spotting different fish and stunning corals, and experiencing the hot springs. Walking alone on the beach at night, feeling the rhythm of the waves, I felt free and connected to the beauty of nature, understanding how life is truly beautiful when you're close to it.

21st Birthday in Hong Kong (April 2024):
My second trip was especially memorable as it was my 21st birthday, and for the first time, I celebrated it abroad—in Hong Kong. We indulged in chocolates, bread, and my favorite Japanese food at midnight on April 25th. I celebrated my birthday at Disneyland, often called the happiest place on earth. Watching short video clips of Disney characters in the castle, I realized how surreal it was to see and feel something I only watched as a kid. The fireworks at Disneyland were magical, creating a moment I’ll never forget. On our last day, we visited Macau. The peaceful atmosphere, nature, and mesmerizing places left a lasting impression on me. This trip broadened my perspective, deepening my understanding of myself and others.

The Power of Travel:
Traveling is more than just visiting new places; it's a transformative experience that shapes who you are and how you see the world. Each journey exposes you to different cultures, ideas, and ways of life, making you more culturally aware and creative. Travel shapes your identity by blending the familiar with the unfamiliar, helping you grow as an individual.`,
