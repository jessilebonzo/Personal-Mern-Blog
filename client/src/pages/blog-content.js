    `Memento Mori reminds us: "Remember, you must die." As Marcus Aurelius wisely advises, "You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think." Seneca echoes this sentiment by highlighting, "This is our big mistake: to think we look forward to death. Most of death is already gone; whenever time has passed, it is owned by death." `,
    `On the other hand, Memento Vivere encourages us to "Remember to live." Seneca points out, "Not how long, but how well you have lived is the main thing." Similarly, Marcus Aurelius emphasizes, "It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live." `,
    `Lastly, Amor Fati teaches us to embrace the "Love of fate." As Marcus Aurelius beautifully puts it, "Not merely to bear what is necessary, still less to hide it, but to love it."`,
